# ðŸ’¼ AI-Driven Customer Churn Predictor & Retention Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a full-stack **AI-powered churn prediction and retention tool** designed to help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving and generate personalized retention strategies. It combines **machine learning, explainable AI, and an interactive dashboard** to deliver actionable business insights.

---

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  - Uses a **Random Forest classifier** trained on customer demographics, account info, product usage, satisfaction scores, complaints, credit info, and more to predict churn probability.  
- **Explainable AI:**  
  - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** shows feature contributions, helping analysts understand *why* a customer might churn.  
- **AI-Powered Retention Strategy:**  
  - Integrates **OpenAI GPT-3** to generate personalized retention suggestions for high-risk customers.  
- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  - Built with **Dash & Plotly**.  
  - Features CSV upload, row-level churn predictions, SHAP feature importance charts, and AI-driven retention strategies.  
- **Professional Look & Feel:**  
  - Desktop-style usability with Bootstrap styling for a clean, professional BI tool experience.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-predictor.git
cd churn-predictor
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the Model
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
4. Run Dashboard
bash
Copy code
python app_dash.py
5. Upload Your Dataset
Upload your customer CSV in the dashboard

Select a row to predict churn

View churn probability, SHAP feature importance, and AI retention strategy

Dataset
The app expects a CSV file with the following columns:

pgsql
Copy code
RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, 
NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, Exited, Complain, 
Satisfaction Score, Card Type, Point Earned
Exited: Target column (1=churned, 0=active)

How It Works
ML Model: Random Forest predicts customer churn.

Feature Scaling & Encoding: Categorical features are label encoded and numerical features scaled.

SHAP Explainability: Visualizes feature contributions per customer prediction.

AI Retention: GPT-3 generates personalized strategies for high-risk customers.

Dash Dashboard: Interactive, professional interface for analysts and decision-makers.

Why It Stands Out
Combines predictive modeling + explainable AI + AI-generated business recommendations.

Professional, interactive dashboard for real-time decision-making.

End-to-end workflow for business analysts + AI integration.
